In a world at war, your base has been invaded by enemies. 
A rescue ship is here to gather all the citizens and evacuate them, 
and you are a commander who manage the defense through a computer screen.
Use the left click to build turrets on the map that will defend the ship, 
until all citizens are gathered. 

Killing enemies make you gain money in order to build stronger turrets.

Use the right/left arrows to switch the current turret profile.
